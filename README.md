# Week 15 Dandi Rizky (Backend Extra)

---

For this week assignment, i'm trying to containerizing the apps from week 14 using docker and creating beautiful documentation using swagger.

## Docker Hub üê≥

---

My Docker Hub Images : https://hub.docker.com/r/dandirizkyy/w15-dandi-myapp

## Installation üî®

---

In order to run this project locally, you need to clone this repository first using git clone

```bash
$ https://github.com/revou-fsse-1/w15-my-backend-extra-DandiRizkyy.git
```

then run `pnpm install` in your terminal to download all dependencies

```bash
$ pnpm install
```

create `docker-compose.yaml` on root folder (where the package.json installed) and fill with these commands to install postgresql database locally on your computer

```
version: '3.9'
services:
  database:
    image: postgres:alpine
    container_name: dandirizky-mydatabase
    hostname: database
    volumes:
    - postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
    - 5432:5432
    env_file:
    - .env
    restart: always
  app:
    image: dandirizkyy/dandirizky-w15-myapp
    container_name: dandirizky-myapp
    build: .
    ports:
    - 4001:4001
    env_file:
    - .env
    depends_on:
    - database
    restart: always
volumes:
  postgres:
```

don't forget to create `.env` files on root folder same like before with these command:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://revou:password@database:5432/revou?schema=public"
```

and run docker with these command:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

after that you can start the server using these following command :

```bash
# development
$ pnpm run start

# watch mode
$ pnpm run start:dev

# production mode
$ pnpm run start:prod
```

if you want to stop docker, you can use these command

```
docker-compose stop
```
